            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for
                English football. Stadiums were deteriorating with poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English
                clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster
                between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division,
                the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La
                Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20]
            </p>
            <p>
                By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup,
                England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on
                English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup
                Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades
                to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of
                Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April
                1989, was published in January 1990.[21]
            </p>
            <p>
                During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial
                principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving
                Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this
                transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and
                revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so,
                they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a
                50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies
                should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in
                importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in
                a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75%
                of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals,
                each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before
                1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988
                negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a "super league", but they
                were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28]
                The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to
                take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller "super league".[29] By the beginning
                of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the
                cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the
                representatives of the "big five" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham
                Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from
                the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs
                in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be
                interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion
                and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of
                the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive
                to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and
                considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991,
                Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the
                ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.

            <h2>Emergence of the "Big Four" 2000s</h2>
            <p>
                The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the "Big 2", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the
                Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called "Big Four"
                clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the
                table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only
                three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02
                and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions
                League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname "The Invincibles" as they became the first
                and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42]
            </p>
            <p>
                In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that "Big Four" dominance threatened the division: "This league is in
                danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."[43] Premier League chief
                executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: "There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the
                Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it
                interesting."[44]
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League
                finals, with only the "Big Four" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008),
                and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007),
                Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds
                United were the only non-"Big Four" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the
                2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07,
                2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in
                1999–2000).
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup
                or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000),
                Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46]
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of
                Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some
                margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in
                fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham
                Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire
                Premier League tenures.

            <h2>Emergence of the "Big Six" (2010s)</h2>
            <p>
                The years following 2009 marked a shift from the "Big Four" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City
                breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the "Big Four" into the "Big Six".[48] In
                the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four
                since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and the
                majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend
                more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season,
                becoming the first club outside the "Big Four" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That
                season also saw two of the "Big Four" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the
                first time since that season.[48]
            </p>
            <p>
                With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for
                qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the
                2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three
                times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their
                record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51]
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the
                league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the "Big Six" to win the
                Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52]
            </p>
            <p>
                Off the pitch, the "Big Six" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing
                that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs
                globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue
                structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future
                success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between
                the "Big Six" and the rest of the division. All of the "Big Six" had revenues greater than €350 million,
                with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was
                the closest club to the "Big Six" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that
                season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham
                – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of
                the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the
                clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from
                around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019
                report, all the "Big Six" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57]

            <h2>Manchester City and Liverpool Duopoly (2020s)</h2>
            <p>
                From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw
                Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years
            </p>
            <p>
                Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier
                League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has
                been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media
                and Sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow
                Muslim players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first
                time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the
                sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow
                for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League
                players decided to take the knee at selected "significant moments". They assured to "remain resolutely
                committed to eradicate racial prejudice".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton
                & Hove Albion breaking the traditional "Big Six" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst
                "Big Six" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions
                Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992,
                after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to
                become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69]
                Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions
                League.
